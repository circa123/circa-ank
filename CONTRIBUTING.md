Please, try to write code that is understandable and beautiful, with a lot of comments.

If possible, attach an explanation of what you changed, and why, although this is not necessary.

Try to make it so the person who edits it next can understand it nicely, and won't have to check in to the nearest shrink after. 

Thanks!
