README

What is circa?
circa is an implementation of some of the basic UNIX commands and GNU Coreutils utilities, licensed under GPLv2.

What is ANK?
ANK (for ANK's Not a Kernel) is a collection of a few programs that attempt to go from just a kernel (Linux, Hurd, BSD, etc.), to a full, complete, system.
ANK's source code is in src/ank/
The headers for ANK and Circa TOGETHER are in src/headers/
And Circa's source code is in src/utils/

What is the purpose of this?
ANK is meant to be a simple way to execute one binary, and get a workable system.
Circa is a collection of utilities that are meant to be used with ANK, but don't have to be.

ANK "BOOT" PROCESS:
cfs/init is executed
cfs/init prints a startup message, and does whatever preparation necessary, then executes cfs/binaries/circa, and hands off control to the Circa shell.
The Circa shell then does an FEC. (fetch execute cycle)

Ok, so how do I build it?
Just run 'make', then 'make fs'

So how do I run it?
Just run 'cfs/init', inside of the CFS folder.

ALSO
