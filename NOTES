NOTES
One of the goals of this software is to have it compile on much older hardware, and work just fine.
So right now, I am putting GNU / Linux on an old Pentium 4 machine, and attempting to replace coreutils and GNU with Circa and ANK!
Also, I broke my monitor because of the horrid monitor stand that caused it to smash onto my keyboard.
Hurray backup monitors!

CTRL + C breaks stuff
And CTRL + Z block doesn't work.

Please someone help with that :)
